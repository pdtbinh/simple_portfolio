                        <p>Binh's performance in my courses was outstanding, earning him the
                             highest grades and showing that he has a clear talent for mathematics,
                              as well as a curious eye and a will to work hard.</p>
                        
                        <p>I am of the opinion that
                               a top grade should signify not only a mastery of the basic contents of
                                the course, but also an ability to solve problems and come up with new ideas.
                                 Looking at Binhâ€™s performance in my courses, it is abundantly clear that he has this ability.</p>
